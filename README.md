# pytorrent
pytorrent is a minimalistic torrent client from command line. Inspired by https://blog.jse.li/posts/torrent/. I wanted to implement the client described in the article using python instead.

# WIP
Please note this project is still a work in progress

# TODO
* Make it run!
* Add unit tests
* Add command line arguments (source-folder, destination-folder, max-workers???)
* Add support for magnet links
* Advertise files? Be nice to our fellow torrenters
